Soon you'll be dead, and this might cross your mind: that there were two
principal aims toward which you could have aspired:

1. To understand the world as fully as is possible to you, given your natural limitations.

2. To feel as good as possible, as often as possible, and experience as much as there is to be experienced.

Sadly the two exist in a sort of opposition, so that the pursuit of one to a
high enough degree seriously hinders one's capacity for pursuing the other.

But worse still, there's this unctuous mire one is made to trudge through, if
one wishes to pursue either at all: that of societal obligations -- not social
obligations, of which there's only one, and it's to not be terrible to the
others -- but the type that swallow up one's days and take over our minds, this
assault of rituals, that turns our life into noise, casting the pursuit of
either principal aims to the stuff of  Sundays and tired evenings and nights;
relegated to the status of half-dreams.
