If I was pressed to categorize myself as a subscriber to some political creed, I
guess I'm something like a
[libertarian socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism),
though I certainly part ways here when it comes to their notion that abolishing
the state altogether is somehow desirable (even if it *were* a possibility that
exists anywhere outside the pipe-dreams of the anarchist's fancy).

The political theorists who have influenced me most are
[John Stuart Mill](/q/john_stuart_mill/),
[Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky), and
[Hannah Arendt](/q/hannah_arendt/).

Of particular interest to me at the moment is the Rojava experiment, and the
post-incarceration writings of Abdullah Öcalan on his political theory of
[democratic confederalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Confederalism).
His short book on the matter is available as a free PDF
[here](http://www.freeocalan.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Ocalan-Democratic-Confederalism.pdf).

(Whether Öcalan and the Rojava experiment will succeed in their putative
goals, and the sincerity of those goals, remains to be seen; but one must admire
the extent to which this vision is being put to practice; and the writings are
both refreshing and real-world applicable.)

I'm a socialist in the sense that I believe any defensible political system must
strive to minimize excessive suffering and coercion and provide some level of
comfort given the resources that are available to it as a whole.

---

I'm a staunch individualist in the sense that I believe that ideal political
systems are those that allow the individual to flourish, and to experience life,
by his own terms.

From this stems my complete rejection of not only right-wing libertarianism,
but also radical egalitarianism: they are both antithetical to individuality
(one by means of coercion or marginalization, the other by means of
extinguishing individuality altogether!)

(Here the notion of "individual" can be extended to groups of individuals,
cultures, and peoples. With this addendum the question naturally arises on the
perils of ascribing "personhood" to collectives: the privileges of which must
not to dwarf those of the individual person.)
