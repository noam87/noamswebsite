It should be painfully clear by now that there are three justice systems: the one for the ultra-rich (who can get away with basically anything), the one for the wealthy and influential (who always get benefit of the doubt and special considerations), and the one for the rest of us: you better not get caught so much as jay-walking.

For all its infighting and finger-pointing over this-privilege and that-privilege, what disappoints me most about the modern left is that it has failed completely to organise against what always has been the most pernicious form of privilege: class privilege.

The fact that they see what is essentially a marketting campaign for the world's largest asset manager ("Fearless Girl" statue) as the halmark symbol of modern feminism to me says it all.

(Dear lefties: I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.)
