I was at the lake last Summer. I picked a mossy old bench to sit, when a group
of adolescents gathered to throw stones into the water.  For an hour they busied
around, making loud gestures and arguing over whose stone made the bigger
splash.  They would try every angle, and then bicker about which one spattered
out the widest, or which one sent the water flying the highest, and how could
they agree on what they'd seen if in a moment it was gone? Finally they
approached me hoping I would settle their dispute, but I'd not seen the water
splash-- they scoffed, frustrated, and went on their way, and I was free to
continue watching the ripples that now adorned the surface of the lake.
