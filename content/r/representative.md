The existence of power-hierarchies is inevitable because of the existence of the
will to power. This is not a moral statement, but an empirical one. However hard
one may work at toppling power structures, and even if one is successful, new
ones will emerge. The only way to escape this would be to eliminate the desire
or means of domination in those who possess them... but here we reach an
intractable contradiction: because to do so would require the exertion on power
by one group on another (that is, those who seek to topple power must dominate
those who seek it, and collude to retain the power to do so indefinitely...  but
this dynamic is itself hierarchical!)

The optimal solution is therefore to side with a preferred hierarchy. This is
after all what a representative democracy is: to select one\'s masters.

Note however that for this strategy to succeed, those at the bottom of the
hierarchy, if they are smart, must at all times mind a singular goal: To ensure
that their masters do not cooperate, and to ensure that they exist in a
completely fragmented state, so that if at any time one of the masters sets in
his mind to not play by the selection rules and dominate completely, the other
masters all use their power individually to counteract this attempt; because
their highest possible ambition is to ensure that they are selected on the next
round.

Ironically, here the collective yields more power than they would in a
non-hierarchical dynamic: This is how peasants keep their masters hostage.
