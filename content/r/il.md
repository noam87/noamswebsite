Political ideologies, when divested of their putative intent and moralisms, are
at their core distributed social algorithms; they are group behaviors that
steer the social structure in one direction or another.

Social group behavior, like all natural processes, obey natural law -- an
incalculably complex set of emergent laws, but natural laws nonetheless -- and
as such, the original intent of one action or another has no bearing whatsoever
on the end result: there is an action, there is a chain of reactions, and there
is an end result.

As the old adage goes, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" -- I
have for some time now abandoned the moralistic approach to my social thinking;
I can draw no other conclusion from our history as a species that at best this
is a useless path (a purely intellectual pursuit of impossible utopias), and at
worst a dangerous gateway to totalitarian thinking.

Of course this perspective has lead me to innumerable frustrations: it is
tacitly understood when addressing social topics that one is considering "soft"
moralistic aspects (just/unjust), and that one must select facts in that
promote an overarching narrative that supports one's sense of the just or
unjust that must be corrected. This is of course utterly irrational and
masturbatory! -- If we assert that objective reality exists, then our "framing"
of it has no bearing one way or the other, only the result of our actions. The
proof, as they say, is in eating the pudding.

As such, I have only the following considerations when thinking about such
things:

#### What is true?

The first step is to make as honest a survey of what is known, knowable,
unknown, and unknowable as far the aspect of reality one is addressing. **This
part should hurt:** Reality rarely conforms to our wants and needs. If it
doesn't hurt, if there are no surprises, if it doesn't at times feel like the
floor is crumbling under your feet, you are doing it wrong.

#### What has changed?

Next we must observe trends. The social order is constantly in flux.

#### What processes are at play?

Now, here we must be careful not to over-simplify the causal relation between
what is changing and the underlying processes.

#### Choose a fitness function

Finally we concede that certain social orders are more desirable to us than
others. Only now can we start thinking about morals and values:

1. There is a process that causes changes in the state of a complex system.
2. Some states are more desirable than others.
3. We cannot precisely determine how changes to the process will affect the
   state.

Here we consider the evolutionary notion of a *fitness function*: we may not be
able to predict exactly how to achieve a particular desirable outcome, but we
*can* measure, along multi-dimensional axes ranging from less-desirable to
more-desirable, whether we are moving towards a more desirable state, or away
from it (and note that these may be independent or not obviously correlated:
one may see a rise in quality of healthcare, but a decline in education at the
same time).

The primary thing to take note of here is that, in opposition to the
ideological approach, the empirical / evolutionary approach says nothing of a
final "desired state"; there is no end-goal. We accept that a) the system is
constantly in flux, and b) its individual members are not only fallible, but
have variable and often conflicting interests.

We're not bothering with with specific moral concerns here; those (the "fitness
function") will change over time. So we are concerned with the "fitness" of the
group as a whole

A heterogeneous society, by definition, can no more achieve a state of
"perfection" than in nature a species can be said to have "completed its
evolution". Perfection is stasis. Only a homogeneous social order can be fully
utopian (there is another word a natural scientist might use to describe a
homogeneous system: "dead"). This is the fundamental basis of all totalitarian
thinking:

> Once the claim [of ideologies] to total validity is taken literally they
> become the nuclei of logical systems in which, as in the systems of
> paranoiacs, everything follows  comprehensibly and even compulsorily once the
> first premise is accepted. [...] Common sense trained in utilitarian thinking
> is helpless against the ideological supersense, since totalitarian regimes
> establish a functioning world of no-sense.
>
> -- Hannah Arendt, *Origins Of Totalitarianism*

In other words, totalitarian thinking is a psychotic attempt to unify cause and
effect, axiom and theorem; the means is the goal and the goal is the means. The
dogma is inherently irrational, yet strives to be all-encompassing; such an
epistemological framework, finding itself at all times in conflict with a
reality that does not conform to its rigid axioms, like a mental virus, can
only survive through the destruction of all "other":

> [Totalitarianism] feverishly seeks to expand, [...] neither for expansion's
> sake nor for profit, but only for ideological reasons: to make the world
> consistent, to prove that its respective supersense has been right.
