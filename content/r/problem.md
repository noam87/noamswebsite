Sumebody submitted to Hacker News this thing where the only rule is "You can't
use the letter 'e'."

```
On may writ lik this.
```

Or

```
You can simply pick words without it.
```

Here's an interesting pproblem:

One can leave out one letter, "e", then another, then another... and measure at what rate does
understandability decrease for people (until eventually it's complete
gibberish (The threshold might be higher than you think: in written Hebrew,
for example, vowels are almost never used; and even in completely ambiguous
cases the correct word is deduced from its context by the reader)).
Also, given a large enough audience, one could try different
combinations of letter-removal order and distribute those randomly, and measure the
same... the question being:

* Which letters are the most vital to understanding written English? or
* Which combinations of letters? Are the letters the same in all the
combinations of a certain rank, or do they differ? (where certain letter
combinations themselves make each other more necessary) -- etc.

Alternatively: the same experiment, but where all words submitted by a user must
match to a dictionary of real words. To that one may even add a grammar checker!
(Which sets of sub-alphabets lend themselves best to proper English? Which allow
for the shortest subsets? -- etc. etc.)

This would be utterly useless and I have no idea how it could be done.

The thing is, the hardest part of solving this puzzle, if one were to try, is
not designing the experiment and writing the code, but executing it at
all! -- That is: figuring out how the hell
to convince a massive audience large enough to collect the significant data to
subject themselves to this experiment in the first place (or, alternatively,
trying to design an
AI that could be subjected to it -- and evolve the AIs themselves until they
excel at deducing unintelligible text -- Would the results be the same for
people and AIs?)...

I like this puzzle because it's so utterly stupid yet it would probably take an
incredibly gifted person who has off-the-charts OCD to actually solve.

If I were a multi-millionaire I would hire a crack-team of engineers and
mathematicians to work non stop on this particular problem; just for the hell of
it.
