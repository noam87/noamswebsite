## CPP

CPP is payed at the end of the year. Save **6%** of your gross income for this.

## Income Taxes

Payed at the end of the year. These are
[bracketed](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html) by income,
but to make calculations simple I just keep a flat **29%** of my monthly
income.

## HST

If you are operating as a freelancer or small business and are expecting to
make over **\$30\_000**, register for an HST account [here](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/rgstrng/menu-eng.html) and charge the customer directly on top of net fee (**13%** in Ontario).
