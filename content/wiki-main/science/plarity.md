Whether a bond between two atoms is polar depends on the difference between
the two atoms' Pauling Electronegativity (their ability to attract electrons).

For example, taking the most common elements in living organisms:

| Element | Pauling Electronegativity |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Phosphorus | 2.19 |
| Hydrogen | 2.20 |
| Carbon | 2.55 |
| Sulfur | 2.58 |
| Nitrogen | 3.04 |
| Oxygen | 3.44 |

So, an `O-H` bond yields `3.44 - 2.20 = 1.24` (polar), while a `C-H` bond
yields `2.55 - 2.20 = 0.35` (low polarity / non-polar).

Polarity exists on a spectrum. Usually one considers anything above `~0.4` polar.

Polarity can be high enough that the bond is no longer a covalent bond,
but an **ionic bond**, where one of the atoms steals the electrons of the other.
