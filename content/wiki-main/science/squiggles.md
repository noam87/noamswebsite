In order to make shorthand easier, chemists omit C and H atoms
from its structural formula. There are two simple rules for adding them back in:



1. <span style="color:red;">All sharp corners represent carbon atoms.</span>
2. <span style="color:blue;">Hydrogen - carbon bonds are implied
(so if a carbon atom has less than 4 bonds, the rest are H).</span>

For example in this formual for a caffeine molecule:

The following is implied:
