## How To Read The Squiggles

In order to make shorthand easier, chemists omit C and H atoms
from its structural formula. There are two simple rules for adding them back in:

1. <span style="color:red;">All sharp corners represent carbon atoms.</span>
2. <span style="color:blue;">Hydrogen - carbon bonds are implied
(so if a carbon atom has less than 4 bonds, the rest are H).</span>

For example in this formual for a caffeine molecule:

The following is implied:

## Is A Chemical Bond Polar?

Whether a bond between two atoms is polar depends on the difference between
the two atoms' Pauling Electronegativity (their ability to attract electrons).

For example, taking the most common elements in living organisms:

| Element | Pauling Electronegativity |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Phosphorus | 2.19 |
| Hydrogen | 2.20 |
| Carbon | 2.55 |
| Sulfur | 2.58 |
| Nitrogen | 3.04 |
| Oxygen | 3.44 |

So, an `O-H` bond yields `3.44 - 2.20 = 1.24` (polar), while a `C-H` bond
yields `2.55 - 2.20 = 0.35` (low polarity / non-polar).

Polarity exists on a spectrum. Usually one considers anything above `~0.4` polar.

Polarity can be high enough that the bond is no longer a covalent bond,
but an **ionic bond**, where one of the atoms steals the electrons of the other.
