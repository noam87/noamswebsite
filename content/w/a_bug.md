**(Unfinished Sketch / In Progress)**

<pre>
It happed one day that through a thick-leaved forest wondered I
And in that dark buzzed what I thought an ordinary fly

...

"If not to pester me, foul creature, why fly thus at night?"
"Let me demonstrate," I heard, and sure enough: a light!
"An ordinary bug I am, surely, in the day;
So when the sun is hid I wake", it said, and led my way.
Sure enough the stars and moon we spotted merrily.
"What such relief!" I thought, then said, and thanked him heartily;
And brighter still my winged friend drew geometric shapes.
Shine where you are seen! we sang,
Shine where you are seen!
