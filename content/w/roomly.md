<pre>
Roomly I dejected your enter.
We bedded on your sit;
Did you kiss to want me?
I wanted to bad you kissly, sure.
I loved you to make want to too.
Real buttly, I felt near you just to get lucky.
And your lovely open looked so wide, sweet eyes.
Your sweet strawberry tastes like a juicy mouth.
O, I'm so long for you, I how in pain!
And I want to proclaim my love for my pride, but you swallow.
Darling, I am so in you, with love.
And every time you stop, my heart looks at me.

Dear love, this me for you will be the death of God.
So leave, don't ever please me.
