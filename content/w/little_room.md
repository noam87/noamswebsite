A set of boots halt just behind Little Room door, mark a pensive hollow in the
casted light on Little Room floor, peak an inch or two, bringing with them an
ounce of sunshine more, and Little Room croaks.

The door shuts behind them; the sun is silenced again.

Little Room is home to feathered insects; bonsai orchards spring out of cracks
on the floor, on which they perch and feed. A girl, sixteen maybe, lost her
virginity there, by one of those cracks, to a crowd of cackling drunkards,
tickled by the feathered pixies, and she thought it was a magical place, and
she could never go back.

The Boots demand a double-shot of Jim from nobody in particular. Another girl,
nineteen, ragged as a doll, but a doll, still, with hair frayed beautifully
like a fractal tuft of burnt shrubbery, offers her body to The Boots, in her
room upstairs, not for his money, just his attention. He takes the drink from
her hand and tosses a coin and immediately forgets she exists.
