## Sentimentality

> Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion,
> is the mark of dishonesty, the inability to feel; the wet eyes of the
> sentimentalist betray his aversion to experience, his fear of life, his arid
> heart; and it is always, therefore, the signal of secret and violent
> inhumanity, the mark of cruelty.

## Inferiority

> It is the peculiar triumph of society -- and its loss -- that it is able to
> convince those people of whom it has given inferior status of the reality of
> this decree; it has the force and the weapons to translated its dictum into
> fact, so that the allegedly inferior are actually made so, in so far as the
> societal realities are concerned.

---

> There exists among the intolerable degraded, the perverse and powerful desire
> to force into the arena of the actual those fantastic crimes of which they
> have been accused, achieving their vengeance and their own destruction
> through making the nightmare real.

## American Moral Contradictions

> Americans, unhappily, have the most remarkable ability to alchemize all
> bitter truths into an innocuous but piquant confection and to transform their
> moral contradictions, or public discussion of such contradictions, into a
> proud decoration, such as are given for heroism on the field of battle.

## Outsider / Insider Dichotomy

> Negroes are Americans and their destiny is the country’s destiny. They have
> no other experience besides their experience on this continent and it is an
> experience which cannot be rejected, which yet remains to be embraced. [...]
> What most significantly fails to be illuminated here is the paradoxical
> adjustment which is perpetually made, the Negro being compelled to accept the
> fact that this dark and dangerous and unloved stranger is part of himself
> forever. [It is] this necessary ability to contain and even, in the most
> honorable sense of the word, to exploit the “nigger,” which lends Negro life
> its high element of the ironic and which causes the most well-meaning of
> their American critics to make such exhilarating errors when attempting to
> understand them.

## Struggle

> I am not one of the people who believe that oppression imbues a people with wisdom or insight or sweet charity.

## Jewish-Black Relations

> There is a subterranean assumption that the Jew should “know better,” that he
> has suffered enough himself to know what suffering means. [...] The Jew, by
> the nature of his own precarious position, has failed to vindicate this
> faith. Jews, like Negroes, must use every possible weapon in order to be
> accepted, and must try to cover their vulnerability by a frenzied adoption of
> the customs of the country; and the nation’s treatment of Negroes is
> unquestionably a custom. The Jew has been taught—and, too often, accepts—the
> legend of Negro inferiority; and the Negro, on the other hand, has found
> nothing in his experience with Jews to counteract the legend of Semitic
> greed. Here the American white Gentile has two legends serving him at once:
> he has divided these minorities and he rules.

---

> But just as a society must have a scapegoat, so hatred must have a symbol. Georgia has the Negro and Harlem has the Jew.
