> He who floats with the current, who does not guide himself according to
> higher principles, who has no ideal, no convictions, -- such a man is a mere
> article of the world's furniture -- a thing moved, instead of a living and
> moving being -- an echo, not a voice. The man who has no inner life is the
> slave of his surroundings, as the barometer is the obedient servant of the
> air at rest, and the weathercock the humble servant of the air in motion.
