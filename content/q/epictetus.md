## Enchiridion

### X

> On the occasion of every accident (event) that befalls you, remember to turn
> to yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use. If you see
> a fair man or a fair woman, you will find that the power to resist is
> temperance (continence). If labour (pain) be presented to you, you will find
> that it is endurance. If it be abusive words, you will find it to be
> patience. And if you have been thus formed to the (proper) habit, the
> appearances will not carry you along with them.

### XI

> Never say about any thing, I have lost it, but say I have restored it. Is
> your child dead? It has been restored. Is your wife dead? She has been
> restored. Has your estate been taken from you? Has not then this also been
> restored? But he who has taken it from me is a bad man. But what is it to
> you, by whose hands the giver demanded it back? So long as he may allow you,
> take care of it as a thing which belongs to another, as travellers do with
> their inn.

### XVII

> Remember that thou art an actor in a play, of such a kind as the teacher
> (author) may choose; if short, of a short one; if long, of a long one: if he
> wishes you to act the part of a poor man, see that you act the part
> naturally; if the part of a lame man, of a magistrate, of a private person,
> (do the same). For this is your duty, to act well the part that is given to
> you; but to select the part, belongs to another.

### XXI

> Let death and exile and every other thing which appears dreadful be daily
> before your eyes; but most of all death: and you will never think of any
> thing mean nor will you desire any thing extravagantly.

### XXIII

> If a man has reported to you, that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not
> make any defence to what has been told you: but reply, The man did
> not know the rest of my faults, for he would not have mentioned these only.

### XXXV

> When you have decided that a thing ought to be done and are doing it, never
> avoid being seen doing it, though the many shall form an unfavourable opinion
> about it. For if it is not right to do it, avoid doing the thing; but if it
> is right, why are you afraid of those who shall find fault wrongly?

### XVII

> If you have assumed a character above your strength, you have both acted in
> this matter in an unbecoming way, and you have neglected that which you might
> have fulfilled.

### XLIII

> Every thing has two handles, the one by which it may be borne, the other by
> which it may not. If your brother acts unjustly, do not lay hold of the act
> by that handle wherein he acts unjustly, for this is the handle which cannot
> be borne: but lay hold of the other, that he is your brother, that he was
> nurtured with you, and you will lay hold of the thing by that handle by which
> it can be borne.

### XLVI

> On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, and do not speak much among the
> uninstructed about theorems (philosophical rules, precepts): but do that
> which follows from them. For example at a banquet do not say how a man ought
> to eat, but eat as you ought to eat. For remember that in this way Socrates
> also altogether avoided ostentation: persons used to come to him and ask to
> be recommended by him to philosophers, and he used to take them to
> philosophers: so easily did he submit to being overlooked. Accordingly if any
> conversation should arise among uninstructed persons about any theorem,
> generally be silent; for there is great danger that you will immediately
> vomit up what you have not digested. And when a man shall say to you, that
> you know nothing, and you are not vexed, then be sure that you have begun the
> work (of philosophy). For even sheep do not vomit up their grass and show to
> the shepherds how much they have eaten; but when they have internally
> digested the pasture, they produce externally wool and milk. Do you also show
> not your theorems to the uninstructed, but show the acts which come from
> their digestion.

### XLVIII

> The condition and characteristic of an uninstructed person is this: he never
> expects from himself profit (advantage) nor harm, but from externals. The
> condition and characteristic of a philosopher is this: he expects all
> advantage and all harm from himself. The signs (marks) of one who is making
> progress are these: he censures no man, he praises no man, he blames no man,
> he accuses no man, he says nothing about himself as if he were somebody or
> knew something; when he is impeded at all or hindered, he blames himself: if
> a man praises him, he ridicules the praiser to himself: if a man censures
> him, he makes no defence: he goes about like weak persons, being careful not
> to move any of the things which are placed, before they are firmly fixed: he
> removes all desire from himself, and he transfers aversion
> (ἔκκλισιν)<sup>1</sup> to those things only of the things within our power
> which are contrary to nature: he employs a moderate movement towards every
> thing: whether he is considered foolish or ignorant, he cares not: and in a
> word he watches himself as if he were an enemy and lying in ambush.
