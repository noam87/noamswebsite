## On The Effectiveness Of Bad Men

> More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more
> effectively than have the people of good will.

## The Purpose Of Nonviolent Direct Action

> I must confess that I am not afraid of the word "tension." I have earnestly
> opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent
> tension which is necessary for growth.

> You may well ask: "Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth?
> Isn't negotiation a better path?" You are quite right in calling for
> negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. **Nonviolent
> direct action seeks to create such a crisis** and foster such a tension that a
> community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the
> issue.

> The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis
> packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore
> concur with you in your call for negotiation.

---

> Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of
> tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already
> alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.

## White Moderates

> I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed
> with the white moderate. **I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion
> that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not
> the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate,
> who is more devoted to "order" than to justice;** who prefers a negative
> peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the
> presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you
> seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who
> paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's
> freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises
> the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season." **Shallow understanding
> from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding
> from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than
> outright rejection.**

## Waiting For Society To Change

> My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil
> rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an
> historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges
> voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up
> their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, **groups tend
> to be more immoral than individuals.**

## When Is The Appropriate Time To Disrupt?

> Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was "well
> timed" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of
> segregation. For years now I have heard the word "Wait!" It rings in the ear
> of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This "Wait" has almost always meant
> "Never."

## Breaking The Law

> I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is
> unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to
> arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality
> expressing the highest respect for law.
