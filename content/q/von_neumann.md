## From Lectures On Self-Replicating Automata (1948?)

> An automaton cannot be separated from the milieu to which it responds.

> The fact that natural organisms have such a radically different attitude about
> errors and behave so differently when an error occurs is probably connected
> with some other traits of natural organisms, which are entirely absent from
> our automata. The ability of a natural organism to survive in spite of a high
> incidence of error (which our artificial automata are incapable of) probably
> requires a very high flexibility and ability of the automaton to watch itself
> and reorganize itself. And this probably requires a very considerable autonomy
> of parts. There is a high autonomy of parts in the human nervous system. This
> autonomy of parts of a system has an effect which is observable in the human
> nervous system but not in artificial automata. When parts are autonomous and
> able to reorganize themselves, when there are several organs each capable of
> taking control in an emergency, an antagonistic relation can develop between
> the parts so that they are no longer friendly and cooperative. It is quite
> likely that all these phenomena are connected.

> Even if the axioms are chosen within the common sense area, it is usually very
> difficult to achieve an agreement between two people who have done this
> independently. For instance, in the literature of formal logics there are
> about as many notations as there are authors, and anybody who has used a
> notation for a few weeks feels that it's more or less superior to any other.
> So, while the choice of notations, of the elements, is enormously important
> and absolutely basic for an application of the axiomatic method, this choice
> is neither rigorously justifiable nor humanly unambiguously justifiable. All
> one can do is to try to submit a system which will stand up under common sense
> criteria.
