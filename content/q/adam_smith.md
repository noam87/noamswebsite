## On Stoicism

> Human life the Stoics appear to have considered as a game of great skill; in
> which, however, there was a mixture of chance \[...\] In such games the stake
> is commonly a trifle, and the whole pleasure of the game arises from playing
> well, from playing fairly, and playing skilfully. If notwithstanding all his
> skill, however, the good player should, by the influence of chance, happen to
> lose, the loss ought to be a matter, rather of merriment, than of serious
> sorrow. He has made no false stroke; he has done nothing which he ought to be
> ashamed of; he has enjoyed completely the whole pleasure of the game. \[...\]

> Our only anxious concern ought to be, not about the stake, but about the
> proper method of playing. If we placed our happiness in winning the stake, we
> placed it in what depended upon causes beyond our power, and out of our
> direction. We necessarily exposed ourselves to perpetual fear and uneasiness,
> and frequently to grievous and mortifying disappointments. If we placed it in
> playing well, in playing fairly, in playing wisely and skilfully; in the
> propriety of our own conduct in short; we placed it in what, by proper
> discipline, education, and attention, might be altogether in our own power,
> and under our own direction. Our happiness was perfectly secure, and beyond
> the reach of fortune.
