Selections from his meditations (Available
[here](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html) for free. One of
my top 10 favorite books. I re-read them every time I disappoint myself.

## II

> A limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing
> away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never
> return.

---

> Through not observing what is in the mind of another man has seldom been seen
> to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movement of their own minds
> must of necessity be unhappy.

## III

> We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but
> also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease
> first.

---

> Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou
> dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility.

---

> A man should use himself to think of those things only about which if one
> should suddenly ask, What hast thou now in thy thoughts? With perfect
> openness thou mightest, immediately answer, This or That;

---

> Always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe
> this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value
> everything has with reference to the whole.

## IV

> Let thy principles be brief and fundamental.

---

> Change thy opinion, if there is any one at hand who sets thee right and moves
> thee from any opinion. But this change of opinion must proceed only from a
> certain persuasion, as of what is just or of common advantage, and the like,
> not because it appears pleasant or brings reputation.

---

> Many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, another
> falls after; but it makes no difference.

---

> Within ten days thou wilt seem a god to those to whom thou art now a beast
> and an ape, if thou wilt return to thy principles and the worship of reason.

---

> How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbour says
> or does or thinks, but only to what he does himself, that it may be just and
> pure; or as Agathon says, look not round at the depraved morals of others,
> but run straight along the line without deviating from it.

---

> Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of the animal which is
> naturally social requires, and as it requires. For this brings not only the
> tranquility which comes from doing well, but also that which comes from doing
> few things.  For the greatest part of what we say and do being unnecessary,
> if a man takes this away, he will have more leisure and less uneasiness.
> Accordingly on every occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the
> unnecessary things? Now a man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but
> also, unnecessary thoughts, for thus superfluous acts will not follow after.

---

> Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is
> remembered.

---

> Everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.

## V

> Judge every word and deed which are according to nature to be fit for thee;
> and be not diverted by the blame which follows from any people nor by their
> words, but if a thing is good to be done or said, do not consider it unworthy
> of thee.  For those persons have their peculiar leading principle and follow
> their peculiar movement; which things do not thou regard, but go straight on,
> following thy own nature and the common nature; and the way of both is one.

---

> Be not disgusted, nor discouraged, nor dissatisfied, if thou dost not succeed
> in doing everything according to right principles; but when thou bast failed,
> return back again; [...] and do not return to philosophy as if she were a
> master, but act like those who have sore eyes and apply a bit of sponge and
> egg.

---

> Art thou angry with him whose armpits stink? Art thou angry with him whose
> mouth smells foul? What good will this danger do thee? He has such a mouth,
> he has such arm-pits: it is necessary that such an emanation must come from
> such things- but the man has reason, it will be said, and he is able, if he
> takes pain, to discover wherein he offends- I wish thee well of thy
> discovery. Well then, and thou hast reason: by thy rational faculty stir up
> his rational faculty; show him his error, admonish him. For if he listens,
> thou wilt cure him, and there is no need of anger.

## VI

> How cruel it is not to allow men to strive after the things which appear to
> them to be suitable to their nature and profitable! And yet in a manner thou
> dost not allow them to do this, when thou art vexed because they do wrong.
> For they are certainly moved towards things because they suppose them to be
> suitable to their nature and profitable to them.- But it is not so.- Teach
> them then, and show them without being angry.

---

> Accustom thyself to attend carefully to what is said by another, and as much
> as it is possible, be in the speaker's mind.

## VII


> Let not future things disturb thee, for thou wilt come to them, if it shall
> be necessary, having with thee the same reason which now thou usest for
> present things.

---

> Think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but of the
> things which thou hast select the best, and then reflect how eagerly they
> would have been sought, if thou hadst them not. At the same time however take
> care that thou dost not through being so pleased with them accustom thyself
> to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if ever thou shouldst not have them.

---

> Indeed in the case of most pains let this remark of Epicurus aid thee, that
> pain is neither intolerable nor everlasting, if thou bearest in mind that it
> has its limits, and if thou addest nothing to it in imagination.

---

> Take care not to feel towards the inhuman, as they feel towards men.

## VIII

> Let no man any longer hear thee finding fault with the court life or with thy
> own.

---

> Enter into every man's ruling faculty; and also let every other man enter
> into thine.
