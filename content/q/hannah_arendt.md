## Understanding

> When I am working, I am not interested in how my work might affect people.
> [And when I am finished] I am finished. What is important to me is to
> understand. For me, writing is a matter of seeking this understanding …
> certain things get formulated. […] What is important to me is the process of
> thought itself.

***

> You ask about the effects of my work on others. If I may wax ironical, that is
> a masculine question. Men always want to be terribly influential, but I see
> that as somewhat external. Do I imagine myself being influential? No. I want
> to understand. And if others understand — in the same sense that I have
> understood — that gives me a sense of satisfaction, like feeling at home.

## Marginalization

> I’m more than ever of the opinion that a decent human existence is possible
> today only on the fringes of society, where one then runs the risk of starving
> or being stoned to death. In these circumstances, a sense of humor is a great
> help.

***

> The fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested first and above all
> in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions significant
> and actions effective.

> [...]

> If a human being loses political status. [...] It seems that a man who is
> nothing but a man has lost the very qualities which make it possible for other
> people to treat him as a fellow-man.

***

> It is quite conceivable, and even within the realm of practical political

## Agency

> It just doesn’t look good when a woman gives orders. She should try not to get

Often misquoted by critics. Whether Hannah lived in a society that deemed her
worthy or capable of pursuing her interests was irrelevant. This society and its
opinions were a thing that existed beyond the scope of her personal influence.
She neither questioned her worthiness nor waited for permission. She simply
acted. She asserted control of the only social agent over which she had control:
herself.

> The idea of humanity, when purged of all sentimentality, has the very serious

> non-political expression of this insight.
