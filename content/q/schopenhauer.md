## Health

> In general, nineâ€”tenths of our happiness depends upon health alone. With
> health, everything is a source of pleasure; without it, nothing else,
> whatever it may be, is enjoyable; even the other personal blessings, -- a
> great mind, a happy temperament -- are degraded and dwarfed for want of it.
> [...] It follows from all this that the greatest of follies is to sacrifice
> health for any other kind of happiness, whatever it may be, for gain,
> advancement, learning or fame, let alone, then, for fleeting sensual
> pleasures. Everything else should rather be postponed to it.

## Happiness

> The safest way of not being very miserable is not to expect to be very happy.

## The "Intellectual Man"

> A man who is privileged in this respect leads two lives, a personal and an
> intellectual life; and the latter gradually comes to be looked upon as the
> true one, and the former merely a means to it. [...] To the life of the
> intellect such a man will give the preference over all his other occupations:
> by the constant growth of insight and knowledge, this intellectual life, like
> a slowly-forming work of art, will acquire a consistency, a permanent
> intensity, a unity which becomes ever more complete.

(Of intellectually shallow wealthy men:)

> He is a mere idler and thief of time, a contemptible fellow. He will not even
> be happy, because, in his case, exemption from need delivers him up to the
> other extreme of human suffering: boredom. [...] He would have been better
> off if poverty had given him something to do.

## Self-Sufficiency

> An intellectual man in complete solitude has excellent entertainment in his
> own thoughts and fancies, while no amount of diversity or social pleasure,
> theatres, excursions and amusements, can ward off boredom from a dullard.

---

> The more a man has in himself, the less he will want from other people, --
> the less, indeed, other people can be to him.
