## From Hávamál

> Praise no day until evening, no wife before cremation, no sword till tested,
> no maid before marriage, no ice till crossed, no ale till it's drunk.

---

> Only a fool lies awake all night and broods over his problems. When morning
> comes he is exhausted. And his troubles are the same as before.
