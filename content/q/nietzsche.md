## Anti-Semitism

(In letter to his sister.)

> Now it has gone so far that I have to defend myself hand and foot against
> people who confuse me with these anti-Semitic canaille; after my own sister,
> my former sister, and after Widemann more recently have given the impetus to
> this most dire of all confusions. After I read the name Zarathustra in the
> anti-Semitic Correspondence my forbearance came to an end. I am now in a
> position of emergency defense against your spouse's Party. These accursed
> anti-Semite deformities shall not sully my ideal!!

---

> I am just having all anti-Semites shot.

## Truth

> The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here,
> perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how
> far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving,
> perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that
> the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are
> the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions,
> without a comparison of reality with the purely *imagined* world of the
> absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by
> means of numbers, man could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions
> would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life. *to recognise untruth as
> a conditioN of life*; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of
> value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has
> thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.

---

> It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is
> precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds. It seems that the
> hundred-times-refuted theory of the "free will" owes its persistence to this
> charm alone; some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to
> refute it.

---

> What is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an
> essential opposition of "true" and "false"? Is it not enough to suppose
> degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of
> semblance.

## History

Of the French Revolution.

> The text has disappeared under the interpretation.

## Axioms

> There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are "immediate
> certainties"; for instance, "I think," [...] I would repeat it, however, a
> hundred times, that "immediate certainty," as well as "absolute knowledge"
> and the "thing in itself," involve a *contradictio in adjecto*; we really
> ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words! The people
> on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the
> philosopher must say to himself: "When I analyze the process that is
> expressed in the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring
> assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps
> impossible: for instance, that it is *I* who think, that there must
> necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and
> operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is
> an 'ego,' and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated
> by thinking --that I *know* what thinking is. [...] In short, the assertion
> 'I think,' assumes that I *compare* my state at the present moment with other
> states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on account
> of this retrospective connection with further 'knowledge,' it has, at any
> rate, no immediate certainty for me." [...] He who ventures to answer these
> metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of *intuitive*
> perception, like the person who says, "I think, and know that this, at least,
> is true, actual, and certain" -- will encounter a smile and two notes of
> interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. "Sir," the philosopher will perhaps
> give him to understand, "it is improbable that you are not mistaken, but why
> should it be the truth?"

GÃ¶deless gracious what a conundrum!

## Solitude

> I am solitude become man.

---

> I go into solitude so as not to drink out of everybody's cistern. When I am
> among the many I live as the many do, and I do not think I really think.
> After a time it always seems as if they want to banish my self from myself
> and rob me of my soul.

---

> Have people around you who are as a garden -- or as music on the waters at
> eventide, when already the day becomes a memory. Choose the *good* solitude,
> the free, wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to
> remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does
> every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means of force! How
> *personal* does a long fear make one, a long watching of enemies, of possible
> enemies!

---

> Eventually one must do everything *oneself* in order to know something; which means that one has *much* to do!

## Social Impulses

> Not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing
> sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him.
> The martyrdom of the philosopher, his "sacrifice for the sake of truth,"
> forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him.

---

> It might be possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate
> and go to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he
> would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he had
> sunk.

## Youth

> Later on, when the young soul, tortured by continual disillusions, finally
> turns suspiciously against itself -- still ardent and savage even in its
> suspicion and remorse of conscience: how it upbraids itself, how impatiently
> it tears itself, how it revenges itself for its long self-blinding, as though
> it had been a voluntary blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by
> distrust of one's sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one
> feels even the good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the
> self-concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all,
> one espouses upon principle the cause *against* "youth." -- A decade later,
> and one comprehends that all this was also still -- youth!

## Revolt

> "Enlightenment" causes revolt, for the slave desires the unconditioned, he
> understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals, he loves as he hates,
> without *nuance*, to the very depths, to the point of pain, to the point of
> sickness -- his many *hidden* sufferings make him revolt against the noble
> taste which seems to *deny* suffering.
