## Main Reasons For Protecting Free Speech

JS Mill presents the reader with four principal arguments. It should be of note
that he does not appeal to man's natural right to free expression, or romantic
notions of "Truth": Mill is solely concerned about the far-reaching societal
consequences of impeding dissent. The four arguments are as follows:

> **First,** if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we
> can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.
>
> **Secondly,** though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly
> does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion
> on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision
> of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being
> supplied.

His two final arguments are often overlooked in discussions of free speech,
though they are vital -- and somewhat counterintuitive:

> **Thirdly,** even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth;
> unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly
> contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of
> a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And
> not only this, but, **fourthly,** the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
> danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the
> character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession,
> inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of
> any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.

Failure to understand arguments 3 and 4 are, I believe, at the
core of much polemic surrounding free speech.

> Truth gains more even by the errors of one who, with due study and
> preparation, thinks for himself, than by the true opinions of those who only
> hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think.

## On Dissent

> When there are persons to be found, who form an exception to the apparent
> unanimity of the world on any subject, even if the world is in the right, it
> is always probable that dissentients have something worth hearing to say for
> themselves, and that truth would lose something by their silence.

## Why Protect and Listen to Objectionable Speech

Mill warns multiple times of the person who has "never thrown themselves into
the mental position of those who think differently from them, and considered
what such persons may have to say":

> The greatest orator of antiquity has left it on record that he always studied
> his adversary's case with as great, if not with still greater, intensity than
> even his own. What Cicero practised as the means of forensic success,
> requires to be imitated by all who study any subject in order to arrive at
> the truth. **He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of
> that.** His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute
> them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite
> side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for
> preferring either opinion. The rational position for him would be suspension
> of judgment, and unless he contents himself with that, he is either led by
> authority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side to which he
> feels most inclination.

But his next observation is essential:

> **Nor is it enough that he should hear the arguments of adversaries from his
> own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they
> offer as refutations.** That is not the way to do justice to the arguments,
> or bring them into real contact with his own mind.  He must be able to hear
> them from persons who actually believe them; who defend them in earnest, and
> do their very utmost for them. He must know them in their most plausible and
> persuasive form; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty which the
> true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of; **else he will never
> really possess himself of the portion of truth which meets and removes that
> difficulty.**

This passage highlights a major failing from many educators and
political writers, who liberally bastardize unfavorable views and weaken their
arguments to make them seem less persuasive, leaving the audience with the
false impression that good morality is self-evident.

> So essential is this discipline to a real understanding of moral and human
> subjects, that if opponents of all important truths do not exist, it is
> indispensable to imagine them, and supply them with the strongest arguments
> which the most skilful devil's advocate can conjure up.

## Should we question moral truths that have long been settled, or should some things not be up for debate?

> How often, when smarting under some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment,
> does a person call to mind some proverb or common saying, familiar to him all
> his life, the meaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now,
> would have saved him from the calamity. There are indeed reasons for this,
> other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths of which the full
> meaning cannot be realised, until personal experience has brought it home.
> But much more of the meaning even of these would have been understood, and
> what was understood would have been far more deeply impressed on the mind, if
> the man had been accustomed to hear it argued pro and con by people who did
> understand it. **The fatal tendency of mankind to leave off thinking about a
> thing when it is no longer doubtful, is the cause of half their errors.** A
> contemporary author<sup>1</sup> has well spoken of "the deep slumber of a
> decided opinion."

On multiple instances, Mill illustrates this paradox in different forms: by
consecrating certain moral principles, by declaring them beyond questioning,
far from protecting them we rob them of their urgency and weaken them.

## Isn't it naive to think that you can change the mind of someone who is set in their way by debating them?

> I acknowledge that the tendency of all opinions to become sectarian is not
> cured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated
> thereby; the truth which ought to have been, but was not, seen, being
> rejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons regarded as
> opponents. But **it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the calmer
> and more disinterested bystander, that this collision of opinions works its
> salutary effect.**

## Speech vs Hate Speech

> This last proviso is of course indispensable. No one pretends that actions
> should be as free as opinions. On the contrary, **even opinions lose their
> immunity, when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to
> constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act.**
> An opinion that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor, or that private
> property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through
> the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an
> excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about
> among the same mob in the form of a placard.

## Silencing Opinions That Are Objectively Wrong

> While every one well knows himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to
> take any precautions against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition
> that any opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples
> of the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable.

---

> The opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may
> possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its truth;
> but they are not infallible. **They have no authority to decide the question
> for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means of judging.**
> To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure that it is false, is
> to assume that their certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty. **All
> silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility.**

---

> It is a piece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any
> inherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and the
> stake. Men are not more zealous for truth than they often are for error, and
> **a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties will
> generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either.**
>
> The real advantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion is
> true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the course of
> ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it, until some one
> of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourable circumstances it
> escapes persecution until it has made such head as to withstand all
> subsequent attempts to suppress it.

## Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences. The laws already permit offensive speech; does that mean we have to tolerate it?

Mill argues that laws are weak compared to social values. Therefore the people
of a free society must themselves do the work to uphold free speech as a social
value, not be merely content with laws that protect them only superficially:

> [compared to laws] it is [social stigma] which is really effective, and so effective is it that the
> profession of opinions which are under the ban of society is much less common
> in England, than is, in many other countries, the avowal of those which incur
> risk of judicial punishment. In respect to all persons but those whose
> pecuniary circumstances make them independent of the good will of other
> people, **opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law;** men might as well
> be imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread.

---

> Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong
> mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it
> ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many
> kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such
> extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more
> deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. **Protection,
> therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough: there needs
> protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling;
> against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil
> penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who
> dissent from them;**

---

> Socrates was put to death, but the Socratic philosophy rose like the sun in
> heaven [...] Christians were cast to the lions, but the Christian church grew
> up a stately and spreading tree [...] Our merely social intolerance kills no
> one, roots out no opinions, but induces men to disguise them [...] With us,
> heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain, or even lose, ground [...] but
> continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and studious persons
> among whom they originate, without ever lighting up the general affairs of
> mankind with either a true or a deceptive light. [...] **A state of things in
> which a large portion of the most active and inquiring intellects find it
> advisable to keep the genuine principles and grounds of their convictions
> within their own breasts, and attempt, in what they address to the public, to
> fit as much as they can of their own conclusions to premises which they have
> internally renounced, cannot send forth the open, fearless characters, and
> logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the thinking world.**

---

> The worst offence of this kind which can be committed by a polemic, is to
> stigmatise those who hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men.

---

> But it is not the minds of heretics that are deteriorated most, by the ban
> placed on all inquiry which does not end in the orthodox conclusions. **The
> greatest harm done is to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental
> development is cramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy.**









## Incomplete Truths And Social Progress

> But there is a commoner case than either of these; when the conflicting
> doctrines, instead of being one true and the other false, share the truth
> between them; and the nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder
> of the truth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part. Popular
> opinions, on subjects not palpable to sense, are often true, but seldom or
> never the whole truth.

> in the human mind, one-sidedness has always been the rule, and many-sidedness
> the exception. Hence, **even in revolutions of opinion, one part of the truth
> usually sets while another rises. Even progress, which ought to superadd, for
> the most part only substitutes one partial and incomplete truth for
> another;** improvement consisting chiefly in this, that the new fragment of
> truth is more wanted, more adapted to the needs of the time, than that which
> it displaces.

---

> In politics, again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of order or
> stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary elements of
> a healthy state of political life [...] Each of these modes of thinking
> derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other; but it is in a great
> measure the opposition of the other that keeps each within the limits of
> reason and sanity.



## The Stifling Of Individuality, Even By Progressives

> But the evil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the
> common modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any
> regard on its own account. The majority, being satisfied with the ways of
> mankind as they now are (for it is they who make them what they are), cannot
> comprehend why those ways should not be good enough for everybody.

> What is more, **spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of the majority of moral
> and social reformers, but is rather looked on with jealousy, as a troublesome
> and perhaps rebellious obstruction to the general acceptance of what these
> reformers, in their own judgment, think would be best for mankind.**

## Political Theory Vs The Real World

> In political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons, success
> discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have concealed from
> observation.

## Progress Through Experimentation

> As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different
> opinions, so is it that there should be different experiments of living; that
> free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to
> others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved
> practically, when any one thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short,
> that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should
> assert itself.

I love the phrase and concept of "Experiments of living".


## Resurgence Of Religion

> What is boasted of at the present time as the revival of religion, is always,
> in narrow and uncultivated minds, at least as much the revival of bigotry;
> and where there is the strong permanent leaven of intolerance in the feelings
> of a people, which at all times abides in the middle classes of this country,
> it needs but little to provoke them into actively persecuting those whom they
> have never ceased to think proper objects of persecution.

## Mediocrity Always Wins

> In sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real or
> supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things throughout the
> world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among mankind.

---

> No government by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its
> political acts or in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it
> fosters, ever did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the
> sovereign Many have let themselves be guided by the counsels and influence of
> a more highly gifted and instructed One or Few. **The initiation of all wise
> or noble things, comes and must come from individuals;** generally at first
> from some one individual.

---

> Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has
> abounded; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been
> proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which
> it contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of
> the time.

## Liberty And Progress Do Not Always Go Hand In Hand

> The spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of liberty, for it may aim
> at forcing improvements on an unwilling people; **and the spirit of liberty,
> in so far as it resists such attempts, may ally itself locally and
> temporarily with the opponents of improvement;** but the only unfailing and
> permanent source of improvement is liberty, since by it there are as many
> possible independent centres of improvement as there are individuals.
