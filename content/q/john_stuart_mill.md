## On Freedom Of Speech

> We have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind (on
> which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, and freedom
> of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we will now
> briefly recapitulate.

> **First,** if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we
> can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.

> **Secondly,** though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly
> does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion
> on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision
> of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being
> supplied.

> **Thirdly,** even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth;
> unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly
> contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of
> a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And
> not only this, but, **fourthly,** the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
> danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the
> character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession,
> inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of
> any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.

> The greatest orator of antiquity has left it on record that he always studied

> even his own. What Cicero practised as the means of forensic success,
> requires to be imitated by all who study any subject in order to arrive at
> the truth. He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that.
> His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them.  But
> if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he
> does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring
> either opinion. The rational position for him would be suspension of
> judgment, and unless he contents himself with that, he is either led by
> authority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side to which he
> feels most inclination.  Nor is it enough that he should hear the arguments
> of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and
> accompanied by what they offer as refutations. That is not the way to do
> justice to the arguments, or bring them into real contact with his own mind.
> He must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them; who
> defend them in earnest, and do their very utmost for them. He must know them
> in their most plausible and persuasive form; he must feel the whole force of
> the difficulty which the true view of the subject has to encounter and
> dispose of; else he will never really possess himself of the portion of truth
> which meets and removes that difficulty.
