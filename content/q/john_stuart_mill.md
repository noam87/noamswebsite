# On Freedom Of Speech

> We have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind (on
> which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, and freedom
> of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we will now
> briefly recapitulate.

> **First,** if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we
> can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.

> **Secondly,** though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly
> does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion
> on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision
> of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being
> supplied.

> **Thirdly,** even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth;
> unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly
> contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of
> a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And
> not only this, but, **fourthly,** the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
> danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the
> character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession,
> inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of
> any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.
