**THIS IS A POOPOO DRAFT**

Excerpts and notes from Mill's *On Liberty*. Some are in the form of a
question-and-answer dialogue to address common misconceptions about free speech.

In part my goal is to help dispel the idea that free speech advocates are all
afflicted by a sort of romantic naivete, foolishly holding on to sentimental
notions of man's "natural right" to speak, or are blind to the paradoxical
threats that arise from "providing aggressors with a platform to spread hate" --
sentiments popularized for example in cartoons like this:

![](/img/fs_1.jpg)

Quite opposite: far from naive, at the root of the utilitarian
conception of free speech lies a cynical view of human nature and the limits of
man's capacity for making sound moral judgement.

Before we explore the intricacies of his essay, let's address the most basic
question:

## Q: What are the main reasons for protecting free speech?

JS Mill presents the reader with four principal arguments.  Note that at no
point does he moralize on man's natural right to free expression, romantic
notions of "Truth", or anything of the sort: Mill is solely concerned about the
far-reaching societal consequences of impeding dissent. The four arguments are
as follows:

> **First,** if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we
> can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.

This is pretty straightforward: we are all flawed; by silencing
those we believe to be in error we may inadvertently silence someone who holds
a valid opinion.

> **Secondly,** though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly
> does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion
> on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision
> of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being
> supplied.

Here we enter slightly more subtle territory: even if one is mostly right, it
is rare that one is *wholly* right; and similarly, there is often a grain of
truth to be found even in the opinion of those who are mostly wrong. Mill
argues that it's only by allowing the two viewpoints to clash that we can
separate the wheat from the chaff.

His two final arguments are often overlooked in discussions of free speech,
though they are vital -- their implications are also rather counterintuitive,
so they must be considered carefully:

> **Thirdly,** even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth;
> unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly
> contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of
> a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And
> not only this, but, **fourthly,** the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
> danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the
> character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession,
> inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of
> any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.

That is, dissent must be encouraged not only to correct popular opinions that
are wrong, but to preserve popular opinions that are right; because when
they become mere dogma, they run the risk of being lost or perverted.

Failure to understand arguments 3 and 4 are, I believe, at the core of modern
polemic surrounding free speech and the "no platform" movement. Thus we end up
with absurd situations in which, for example, children's authors who write
cautionary tales of racism [are instead accused of promoting
it](http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/the-toxic-drama-of-ya-twitter.html).

## Q: Isn't it naive to think that you can change a Racist's mind by debating them?

It would of course be naive to expect a staunch white supremacist to change his
mind half way through a public debate...

> I acknowledge that the tendency of all opinions to become sectarian is not
> cured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated
> thereby; the truth which ought to have been, but was not, seen, being
> rejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons regarded as
> opponents. But **it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the calmer
> and more disinterested bystander, that this collision of opinions works its
> salutary effect.**

When debating a racist, whether in public life or in an academic setting, your
goal is not to convince the racist. Instead keep in mind that every debate has
an audience; this audience will encompass an entire spectrum of persuasions and
life experiences. Being witness to an open and respectful debate could be the
catalyst that sets someone to question their beliefs.

Back in 2010 I went down to the US for Jon Stewart's [Rally To Restore
Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally\_to\_Restore\_Sanity\_and/or\_Fear)
and invited someone I knew down there to come with me. They're not a
particularly political person, but I thought it would be a fun experience for
them. The speeches were the usual sort of tame liberal banter I'd think
nothing much of, growing up with two activist parents. Anyway, halfway through
the monologue I remember my friend turned to me, wide eyed, and said "Wow!
I'd never thought of it that way! -- **I never heard people say things like
that!**"

Wherever we go we are ambassadors of our moral convictions -- our actions, and
more importantly how they are perceived, may be the only point of reference for
an outsider -- *someone who has simply never been exposed to our point of view,
because they never had a reason to*. As viscerally satisfying as it is to tar
and feather opponents and kick them out of town, we must always be wary of
setting up ideological ghettos where hate and resentment can only fester and
grow.

## Truth Does Not Prevail
