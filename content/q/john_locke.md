## The Difference Of Wit And Judgement

> Men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the
> clearest judgment or deepest reason. For wit lying most in the assemblage of
> ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be
> found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and
> agreeable visions in the fancy; judgment, on the contrary, lies quite on the
> other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas wherein can be
> found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and
> by affinity to take one thing for another. This is a way of proceeding quite
> contrary to metaphor and allusion; wherein for the most part lies that
> entertainment and pleasantry of wit, which strikes so lively on the fancy,
> and therefore is so acceptable to all people, because its beauty appears at
> first sight, and there is required no labor of thought to examine what truth
> or reason there is in it.
