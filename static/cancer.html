  </p>

  <h3>Early 2013</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> First notice dark mark on scalp. Dr says it's birth mark.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>October 2013</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Notice lump in back of neck (swollen lymph node).
      <li> Two doctors say it's nothing.
      <li> Putting 2+2 together, I demand biopsy.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>January 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Results come back positive for malignant melanoma (stage IIIc at this
      point; total fuckup from Doctors, who basically reduced my 5-year survival odds
      from 90% to 20%. Most doctors
      are bad at their job, have huge egos, and not at all focus on diagnosis and prevention,
      <b>do your own research always</b>).
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>March 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b class="treatment">Surgery #1</b>: Removal of lymph nodes in back of neck to the right (one enlarged), and skin graft to scalp.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>April 8, 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 lymph node came back positive.
      <li> New lump (visibly swollen) found under right ear. Waiting for second surgery date.
      <li> Nodules in lungs show up in CT. No change in size between scans so not necessarily melanoma.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>April 05, 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> More lymph nodes removed from neck. A few are swollen. One positive for melanoma.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Summer 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
     <li> <b class="treatment">Surgery #2</b>.
     <li> Entered <b class="treatment">Ipilimumab (Yervoy)</b> trial for adjuvant treatment. 3 mg/kg.
     <li> Finished 4 infusions.
     <li> Only side effects are mild tiredness, muscle weakness.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>September 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
     <li> Melanoma came back in one lymph node in the neck (same site as before).
     <li> <b class="treatment">Surgery #3</b> for removing lymph nodes.
     <li> Some facial nerves damage (trouble moving right side lower lip), and right side of neck very swollen this time.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>November 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b class="treatment">First round of maintenance Ipilimumab</b> (every 3 months). 3 mg/kg.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>June 2016</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
     <li> 4 Lung nodules found. No symptoms. Now officially stage IV.
     <li> <b class="treatment">Start PD-1 Inhibitor</b> infusions.
     <li> Not many side effects, but being lead developer for early-stage
     startup while dealing with stage IV cancer is definitely not recommended.
     Two thumbs down.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>September 2016</h3>

  <img src="/img/point.jpeg" alt="me" width="300px">

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Hospital after enlarged lung tumor, swollen lungs. Worst pain ever!  Insane pain. Almost couldn't breather for 2 hours. Finally they give me antiinflamatories that work. (Picture above.)
      <li> PD-1 failed obviously. Lung tumors 4x4 cm.
      <li> <b class="treatment">Started BRAF + Mekinist combo</b>.
      <li> Feel almost immediately better. Riding my bike 3 days after hospital visit.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>November 2016</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Lung tumors seem shrinking and stable. Shrank to 6mm.
      <li> Side effects are manageable: some tiredness, muscle weakness, I get a really high fever every 2-3 weeks and have to discontinue for a few days until subsides.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>February 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Really bad upper back pain, persists through the night.
      <li> New tumor near spine pressing on nerves, and another one upper chest (lung?) found.
      <li> Spine very painful, Hard time sleeping or focusing.
      <li> Given morphine pills. I only take the quick-release every couple of
      days when needed. Back pain has plateaued.
      <li> Back pain mysteriously better since the 5th, so no excuse to take
      morphine. Double poop.
      <li> <b class="treatment">Two back-to-back sessions of high dose radiation</b> to spine
      tumor.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>March 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Have to go 4 weeks treatment-free to be able to enter clinical trial.
      <li> Back pain is back. Taking a lot of Advil / Tylenol / morphine.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>April 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b class="treatment">lung biopsy</b> for trial.
      <li> Receive first infusion for
        <b class="treatment">Phase I trial for PD-1 + immune therapy combo</b>
        (MTIG7192A + Atezolizumab) (<a
        href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02794571">trial link</a>).
      <li> Second <b class="treatment">lung biopsy for trial</b>. This one hurt.
      <li> Second <b class="treatment"> infusion for MTIG7192A trial</b>.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>May 2017</h3>

  <img src="/img/xrayjune2017.png" alt="lungs xray" width="600px">
  <a href="/img/xrayjune2017.png">Full Resolution</a>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Trial failed, mass in right lung grew to 12x10cm, left lung mass
      larger and wrapping around rib.
      <li> Spent two weeks in bed in hospital: right lung mass extremely
      painful, left lung partially collapsed and filled with fluid, some sort
      of lung infection (fever).
      <li> <b class="treatment">left lung fluid drained</b>.
      <li> <b class="treatment">antibiotics</b>.
      <li> <b class="treatment">24/7 IV moprhine + oxygen mask</b>.
      <li> <b class="treatment">5 sessions of radiation to mass on right lung</b>.
      <li> <b class="treatment">Trying mekinist + dabrafenib (BRAF targeted
      therapy) combo</b> again.
      <li> First week at home spent mostly in bed. Slowly feeling better.
      <li> First xray shows right-lung tumor slightly smaller, possibly from
      either radiation or drugs.
      <li> Very little fluid in lungs, no need for more tubes.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>July 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Back pain is returning. Doctor thinks BRAF meds might be wearing off
      again.
      <li> Pain extends to elbow now too.
      <li> CT scan shows no change in right-lung tumor, left-lung tumor
      doubled in size, pushing on ribs and clavicle.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>August 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b class="treatment">Surgery: biopsy of left-lung tumor</b> to
      harvest for possibly <a
      href="http://melanomainternational.org/2015/05/til-therapy-for-melanoma-magic-bullet-or/#.WYpjJdPyveQ">TIL</a>
      therapy.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Sept 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> I HAVE KIDNEY STONES. Seriously? -- Extremely painful day at the
      hospital.
      <li> TILs were successfully harvested. Scans show no new disease, but left
      tumor is increasing in size, causing damage to ribs and a lot of pain.
      <li> TIL therapy postponed. Will talk to radiation about treating tumor
      with radiation first to control pain.
      <li> Pain is now debilitating. Pretty much lost use of my left arm at
      times, and
      can't lift anything due to back pain. Significant loss of mobility.
      <li> Increased hydromorphone dose and on a course of steroids to reduce
      inflamation, pain a little better.
      <li> <b class="treatment">Radiation: one week</b> of radiation to left
      shoulder tumor. Looked at the CT scan, it extends all the way down to the
      ribs above the heart -- pressing on a lot of nerves and causing pressure
      to rubs.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>October 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> After radiation, tumor in shoulder shrank after two weeks. Back / arm
      pain significantly decreased. Lowered hydromorphone dose from 74mg / day
      to 12mg / day.
      <li> Extreme fatigue for a few weeks.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Nov 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> New scans show no new mets again. Right lung tumor keeps shrinking,
      slowly (shrank by less than a cm in diameter). Left lung tumor
      (the one radiated end of September) also shrinking. Improved condition
      in lungs, though still some ground glass in the imaging. Areas of
      atelectasis have not improved. Still showing rib destruction on left side.
      <li> TILs are going to be held off since there doesn't seem to be any
      disease progression.
      <li> Been having strange symptoms: rash and dryness on back and face,
      fever every night, fatigue, flu-like feeling in chest and shortness of
      breath. Dr not sure what it is, possibly the dabrafenib/mek combo, but
      even being off it for a week has not improved.
      <li> My left shoulder is all messed up and sometimes dislocates. Possibly
      from tumor or radiation.
      <li> Sharp pain in left rib (can't breathe in all the way).
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Dec 2017 - March 01, 2018</h3>

  <h4>Three months of hell.</h4>

  <p>
    During a routine visit, they realise I've been bleeding internally and
    am anemic, I am immediately hospitalized at Toronto General Hospital
    and then moved to Princess Margaret Cancer Centre
    for what will turn out to be three months of serious complications (oddly
    enough, this is just a month after my last scan, which showed no disease
    progression... then all of a sudden all hell broke loose):
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scans show: new extracranial tumor, partly infiltrating my skull; new
        tumors in GI track, one is bleeding; more growth in near-spine tumor;
        low blood cell count; new tumor near lining of the heart; new bone
        metastasis in hip and leg.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">Surgery: bowel recession</span> for the bleeding
        GI tumor. After a lot of trying, they find the bleed coming from a
        tumor in the small intestines. Only that tumor is removed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">Three blood transfusions</span> due to
        constantly dropping red blood counts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">Chemotherapy:</span> three rounds Dec - Jan of
        chemo in hopes of temporarily managing the new mets..
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">I require magnesium infusions like twice a week</span>
        since my levels keep dropping.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">Painkiller dose increase:</span> now up to
        30 mg Hydromorphone slow release, three times daily + 12 mg multiple
        times a day, as needed for breakthrough pain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">Radiation to extracranial tumor:</span>Luckily
        they are able to use very targeted beams and most of my brain is
        spared... though a small area was radiated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">Radiation to near-spine tumor at T1-T2:</span> it is
        starting to press on nerves and they worry it could reach the spine
        itself. I am warned this treatment comes with a ~15% chance of causing paralysis
        a year down the line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">I am given a PICC line</span>since the daily
        poking and insertion of IV tubes is starting to cause many collapsed
        veins and pain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Three days after PICC is inserted, during a CT scan the PICC
        accidentally gets displaced into my jugular and has to be replaced. Fun
        times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="treatment">Radiation to ribs:</span> rib mets were starting
        to cause damage and pain to ribs.
      </li>
      <li>
        I weigh 132 lb.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point, something goes wrong with my heart, and it starts beating
        at <strong>160 BPM (standing) 140 BPM (resting)</strong>. Cardiologists are not able
        to figure out why, and as of this writing (April) my resting heart rate
        is still 120 - 140 BPM. For some reason, Dexamethasone will temporarily
        bring it back down to normal range (70 BPM). This new heart condition
        causes me a lot of fatigue and disability... not to mention my constant
        worry of suddenly dropping dead from a cardiac event.
      </li>
      <li>
        I spend a full month completely bedridden, unable to walk altogether,
        even to go to the bathroom. My heart rate often shoots to 170-180 merely
        from standing up. After a month, I am finally able to stand up and walk
        a few feet, but for my whole stay I am mostly bedridden. I am unable to
        lie on my side due to rib pain... it was truly an indescribably excruciating
        experience to lie in the same bed, in the same position, for three
        months straight. This is the first time I felt desperate.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am finally allowed to go home on March 1<sup>st</sup>. I am still
        mostly bedridden but I can't take the hospital anymore.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>March 2018</h3>

  <h4>Still doing terrible but man it's good to be home!</h4>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mostly unable to put on weight. Still weigh ~135 lb.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heart rate still at 120-140 resting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extreme pain in shin turns out to be bone metastasis. <span
        class="treatment">I am given radiation to the tibia.</span> This renders
        me unable to walk for a few weeks again, completely bedridden /
        wheelcair.
      </li>
      <li>
        Still mostly bedridden. Some weeks completely, though here and there I
        get bursts of energy and am able to go for a wheelchair stroll.
      </li>
      <li>
        Odd side effect: I've been shedding massive amounts of dandruff and dry
        skin from my scalp, forehead, and face.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am having excruciating pain in my right hand, often unable to close it
        or grip anything.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>April</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dr. thinks hand pain could be gout. I am given
        <span class="treatment">colchicine</span> for a few weeks which seems
        to help.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scans show an unexpected mixed response: there is a new liver and lung
        met, and seemingly a bone met in the right leg as well, but most other
        tumors have shrunk since last scan. Dr. doesn't think this is from
        chemo, so could be a delayed response to something else?
      </li>
      <li>
        Hand pain does not go away and is barely manages by the painkillers...
        very frustrating and debilitating. Luckily leg pain has gotten better.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've been having an increase in back, rib, and hip pain, even though the
        scans show no reason for this to be so.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>May</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <li>
        Having a liver met means I can start application for a trial for
        <span class="treatment">trial for Nivolumab + LAG-3 antibody</span>.
        They do a bunch of tests (<span class="treatment">liver biopsy</span>
        along with bone scan and other tests). However, not getting my pain
        under control would disqualify my from trial.
      </li>
      <li>
        LAG-3 is rescheduled for June because pain keeps getting worse. More
        scans show that hand pain is caused my "moth eaten" bones in hand, most
        likely melanoma, not gout.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scans show progressing bones mets in hand, left femural head, right
        knee, ribs, and skull.
        I am given <span class="treatment">radiation</span> to hand, right knee,
        and left hip (hoping trial will resolve skull met).
      </li>
      <li>
        I have an episode of extreme pain in right leg (unable to even get out
        of stretcher). Luckily a course of <span
        class="treatment">steroids</span> fixes it within hours. (However,
        washout period for steroids is three weeks for the trial.)
      </li>
      <li>
        My right hand is completely debilitated and throbs constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pain is extreme, often excruciating. Opiate painkillers don't work
        anymore even at the dose I'm in. <span
        class="treatment">Gabapentin</span>  helps with some of the pain,
        but the side effects interfere with my quality of life. I switch to a
        different opiate, which helps a little, but it's still a bandaid
        solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        Will possibly try Methadone or Ketamine therapy to manage pain.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
