      One new tumor in upper lung/chest. Two stable in lungs with
      Dabrafenib/Mekinist combo. One new tumor one in spine pinching nerve and
      causing a LOT of constant pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting to see radiologist for radiation treatment
      to spine. Waiting to see new medical trial team to see if there's something
      new to try.

  </p>

  <h3>Early 2013</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> First notice dark mark on scalp. Dr says it's birth mark.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>October 2013</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Notice lump in back of neck (swollen lymph node).
      <li> Two doctors say it's nothing.
      <li> Putting 2+2 together, I demand biopsy.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>January 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Results come back positive for malignant melanoma (stage IIIc at this
      point; total fuckup from Doctors, who basically reduced my 5-year survival odds
      from 90% to 20%. Most doctors
      are bad at their job, have huge egos, and not at all focus on diagnosis and prevention,
      <b>do your own research always</b>).
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>March 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b class="treatment">Surgery #1</b>: Removal of lymph nodes in back of neck to the right (one enlarged), and skin graft to scalp.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>April 8, 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 lymph node came back positive.
      <li> New lump (visibly swollen) found under right ear. Waiting for second surgery date.
      <li> Nodules in lungs show up in CT. No change in size between scans so not necessarily melanoma.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>April 05, 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> More lymph nodes removed from neck. A few are swollen. One positive for melanoma.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Summer 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
     <li> <b class="treatment">Surgery #2</b>.
     <li> Entered <b class="treatment">Ipilimumab (Yervoy)</b> trial for adjuvant treatment. 3 mg/kg.
     <li> Finished 4 infusions.
     <li> Only side effects are mild tiredness, muscle weakness.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>September 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
     <li> Melanoma came back in one lymph node in the neck (same site as before).
     <li> <b class="treatment">Surgery #3</b> for removing lymph nodes.
     <li> Some facial nerves damage (trouble moving right side lower lip), and right side of neck very swollen this time.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>November 2014</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b class="treatment">First round of maintenance Ipilimumab</b> (every 3 months). 3 mg/kg.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>June 2016</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
     <li> 4 Lung nodules found. No symptoms. Now officially stage IV.
     <li> <b class="treatment">Start PD-1 Inhibitor</b> infusions.
     <li> Not many side effects, but being lead developer for early-stage startup while dealing with stage IV cancer is stressful! No time to myself.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>September 2016</h3>

  <img src="/img/point.jpeg" alt="me" width="300px">

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Hospital after enlarged lung tumor, swollen lungs. Worst pain ever!  Insane pain. Almost couldn't breather for 2 hours. Finally they give me antiinflamatories that work. (Picture above.)
      <li> PD-1 failed obviously. Lung tumors 4x4 cm.
      <li> <b class="treatment">Started BRAF + Mekinist combo</b>.
      <li> Feel almost immediately better. Riding my bike 3 days after hospital visit.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>November 2016</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Lung tumors seem shrinking and stable. Shrank to 6mm.
      <li> Side effects are manageable: some tiredness, muscle weakness, I get a really high fever every 2-3 weeks and have to discontinue for a few days until subsides.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>February 2017</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Really bad upper back pain, persists through the night.
      <li> New tumor on spine pressing on nerve, and another one upper chest (lung?) found.
      <li> Spine very painful, Hard time sleeping or focusing.
      <li> <b class="treatment">Given appointment for radiation to spine
      tumor.</b> I'll receive high dose radiation to the tumor near the spine.
      Luckily the tumor is not yet attached to the spine, which would mean risk
      of paralysis from radiation. Current risks: nerve damage, broken ribs from
      radiation.
      <li> They will test previously-harvested tumors for PD-1 positivity, and
      try to get me into <b class="treatment">Phase-I trial for a PD-L1 drug + new immune therapy
      combo</b>. -- Phase-I means this drug has not yet been tested in humans, so I
      don't know what my odds of response are. Drug is being tested to find out
      whether they work at all, and whether they are safe for humans... not
      holding my breath here.
      <li> If I do get into a trial, they'll have to harvest more tumor
      samples... this means <b class="treatment">biopsies to both lungs</b>... ouch. (Unless cancer
      spreads somewhere else more easily-harvestable. Always a silver lining!)
      <li> Drug coverage system is positively full-retard. I would have liked to
      be treated again with a PD-1 + Ipilimumab combo during radiation, due to
      their known (though improbable) triggering of a response through the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscopal_effect">abscopal effect</a>,
      however, having already been treated once with those drugs, I no longer
      qualify to be treated again... <b>even though immune and targeted
      therapies, unlike chemo therapies, have been documented to work upon
      rechallenge (<a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22584957?dopt=Abstract&holding=npg">example</a>).</b>
      Will I be able to get back on BRAF should I fail the trial?
      <li> Also wait times are fucking ridiculous. 3 weeks to wait for harvest
      results to know if I qualify for trial. Then can only start trial 3 weeks
      after radiation. Will have to discontinue working drug for trial. Dumb.
    </ul>
